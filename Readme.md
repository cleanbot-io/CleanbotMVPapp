# temporary place for notes
Schedule screen notes:
@todo: show choose date if one isn't planned. <Button title='Choose Date' style={styles.btns} /> 

like wise, hide date for next clean and show choose date button, when one is not
scheduled. Will hide "next clean date" on the top of the screen, and start adding
the functionality to set a date from the button.
